2/ token - input text broken into tokens ers
3. vectors - meaning to be derived ..close to the meanign words..similar meaning words placed cloe to earch other.. opp meaning words far away.. 
4. attention - derive meaning ..apple - which one to attend..nearyb words which add to the context.. generate nearby vectors .. ambiguous vectros.. 2 vector.. vector of apple to vec tor of revenue.. ccombination of tasty vector..apple vector.. output is bananca,, chiku etc
5. Self supervise learning - eyes, fingers.. 54321..other eye looking..even if ibalnk..inherent strcuture.. trained model , penalise.. predict.. et tu brutos..image model removing patches and adding patches
6. transformer - algo by which it predicts next output
7. Fine tuning - predict next token for an input sequence.... train base model.. transformer.. series of questions and answers..this process is fine tuning ;..who is president. of US.."i also would like to now".. that is not desirationable
8. Few shot pompting.. where is my order... example prompting
9. Retrieval augmented generation - RAG..policy docs
10. vector DB - I am upset with your payment system expect a refund.. .. docs upset.. user low rating , drops off..upset means that ..semantic meaning. close in distance vectors.. fetch those and use that to add context.
incomeing query..add v1 close and given output..store docs in the Vector DB ,..is blackbiox thing.. information about our comany and DB
11. MCP Model context protocol - trf context into maode.. you hv LLm and incomeing query... which fwd.. LLM decisions..externall tools to conenct.. MCP server connect.. indigo, airindia.. response get flight details from each airline..alongwith user queru nad also adding external servers which you can consulme and amekdecision.. results ..then api call to Air India
12. Context engineering - few shot prompting - RAG  (vecotr DB) and MCP ..user prefence and 
prompt context summarization..sliding window..last 100 chats to LLM and rpebious chats into 5 seneces.. 
13. Agents =- l;ong runnign proces. api call. query llms query external systemsn and other agents.. to meet .. travel agen.. fgliht, hotel, email.. hyped term
14. Reinformecement leaning.. give to response ..choose chatgpt option.. make user happy.. feedbck.. +1, -1
..reinforce good putputs
15. chain of thought - step by step breakdown.. new steps can be addede.. deepseek.. 
16. reasoning models - how to solve a problem.LRM.. deepseek and open AI.. newer models
17. Multi model models ..any kind of mode.. better then text.. marketing - text , image, video.. 
18. Small language models - company specific .. they want data close to them..and according to them.. fewer pareamets.. - 3m parametres.. LLM - 3-300 BN paratmeents.. neural netwal.. but SLM smaller.. trained on lesser data comany specific.. taske specici.. query user .. ..trained by compaies.. for specific user cases
19 . process SLM - distiallation - look at putuper of LLM (teacher.. preductputout.. student SLM -- micics the output.. condexe info of LLM ino SLM.. such 30300 M.. such that perf is better 
20. quanitzation - reduce the bit.s..from 30 bits to 8 bits.. inference..
